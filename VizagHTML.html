                is a soothing sight to your sore eyes and tired souls. The waters of Rushikonda are as
                blue as it can get and you will be hard pressed to find a beach this soothing to the
                senses. It is one of the cleanest beaches in Vizag. Set in the midst of lush vegetation
                adjacent to the shoreline, it is known for its mesmerizing scenery. The beach is a
                favorite among water sports lovers. Being a beach on the east coast, it is a pleasure to
                see the sunrise from here and the sunsets are equally dreamy.
                • Food: Lip-smacking delicacies that are sold in the hill-top restaurants with
                mesmerizing views of the sea.

                swimming, and sea kayaking. (Much of these are halted during monsoons.)

                suitable for quiet evening walks.</p>
